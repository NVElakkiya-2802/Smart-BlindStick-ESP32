# Smart-BlindStick-ESP32
IoT-based smart blind stick that enhances mobility for visually impaired users by detecting obstacles using ultrasonic sensing and providing audio/haptic feedback for safe navigation.
# Smart Blind Stick 

# Project Description
The Smart Blind Stick is an assistive embedded system designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby obstacles and alerts the user through a buzzer and LED.

# Features
- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor
- Audio alert using buzzer
- Visual alert using LED
- Low-cost assistive solution
- Simulated using online tools

# Components Used
- ESP32 
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- LED
- Resistor
- Jumper wires

# Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to obstacles. If an object is detected within a certain range, the buzzer and LED are activated to alert the user.

# Simulation
This project was simulated using Wokwi online simulator.

# Applications
- Assistive device for visually impaired people
- Obstacle detection system
- Embedded systems learning project
